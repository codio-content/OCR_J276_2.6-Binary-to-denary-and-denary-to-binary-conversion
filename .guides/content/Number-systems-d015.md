Every digit in a number system has a **place value**.
We are more familiar with the denary or decimal system which uses 10 digits â€“ 0 to 9 and is a base 10 system.

When we display a number in this system the value of each digit is given by its place with the value of each digit being 10 times the value of the digit to its left. 
These values are therefore equal to powers of 10.

Therefore 6,393 can be written as:
(6 * 1000) + (3 * 100) + (9 * 10) + (3 * 1) = 6,393

The binary system has similar place values but they increase by powers of 2.

The following table shows the place values for the digits in a Byte - 8 bits. They are powers of 2 as it is a base 2 system.
