Move from left to right:

- Is the number (203) equal to or greater than 128? If it is place a ‘1’ at this place value and if not place a ‘0’
In this case 203 is greater than 128. 
Therefore place a ‘1’ in this column and calculate the remainder.

The remainder is 75.

- Is 75 greater than or equal to 64? Yes, therefore place a ‘1’ in the 26 column.

The remainder is 11.

- Is 11 greater than or equal to 32. No, therefore place a ‘0’ in this column.

![](.guides/img/grid6.png)

The remainder is still 11.

- Is 11 equal to or greater than 16? No, therefore place a ‘0’ in this column.

![](.guides/img/grid7.png)
The remainder is still 11.

- Is 11 equal to or greater than 8? Yes, therefore place a ‘1’ in this column.

![](.guides/img/grid8.png)

The remainder is now 3.

- Is 3 equal to or greater than 4? No, therefore place a ‘0’ in this column.

![](.guides/img/grid9.png)
The remainder is still 3.

- Is 3 equal to or greater than 2? Yes, therefore place a ‘1’ in this column.
![](.guides/img/grid10.png)
The remainder is now 1.

- Is 1 equal to or greater than 1? Yes, therefore place a ‘1’ in this column.
![](.guides/img/grid11.png)

There is now no remainder.

Therefore **203** in denary is represented by **11001011** in binary.
